        <h2>How to Play PongGame ?</h2>
        <p>
            In the PongGame project, there are two players who control paddles. Player 2 operates their paddle with the up and down arrow keys, while Player 1 uses the 'W' key for moving up and the 'S' key for moving down. Importantly, even in the pause state, the paddles continue to respond to 'W,' 'S,' as well as the up and down arrow inputs from the players.
